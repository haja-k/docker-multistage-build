## ⚡ Description
Explore the power and efficiency of Docker's multistage build feature through this repository. The code within this repository serves as a hands-on experiment, showcasing the implementation of Docker multistage builds to optimize container images and enhance the overall development and deployment process.

## ⚡Flow
Create a basic Python application that includes a simple print statement and a package specified in the requirements.txt file as the primary content for the final Docker image. Then, examine the size differences in the resulting images by compiling the same codebase using two distinct folders, each with its own Dockerfile. This experiment aims to compare and understand the variations in image sizes resulting from different Docker build configurations.
